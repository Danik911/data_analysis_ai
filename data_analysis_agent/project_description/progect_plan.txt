1. Data Preparation (10% of grade)
Enhanced Data Quality Assessment:

Implement systematic data type verification for all columns
Check value ranges with statistical justification (e.g., Tukey's method for outliers)
Verify uniqueness of Case Numbers and handle any duplicates
Identify and handle impossible values (negative distances/times, unreasonable values)
Create data quality report including:

Missing value counts and patterns
Outlier identification with Z-scores and IQR method
Distribution analysis pre-cleaning with normality tests



Cleaning Implementation:

Standardize 'Mode' values with frequency analysis to identify potential typos
Document cleaning decisions with statistical justification
Generate before/after comparison metrics
Preserve original data and document transformation steps

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (30% of grade)
Comprehensive Statistical Analysis:

Calculate for both overall dataset and by-mode subsets:

Central tendency (mean, median, mode)
Dispersion metrics (standard deviation, variance, IQR)
Distribution characteristics (skewness, kurtosis)
Confidence intervals for key metrics
Correlation analysis between Distance and Time
Statistical significance testing between modes



Advanced Visualization Suite:

Distribution analysis:

Histograms with normal curve overlays
Density plots for comparison across modes
Q-Q plots to assess normality assumptions


Relationship visualization:

Scatter plots with trendlines by mode
Box plots showing Time distributions by Mode
Violin plots for comparing distributions


Correlation visualization:

Correlation heatmaps
Pair plots with regression lines



3. Model Building & Evaluation (40% of grade)
Comprehensive Regression Analysis:

Linear regression implementation:

Full dataset model (Time ~ Distance)
Individual models for each Mode (with focus on Cycle data)
Calculate robust metrics: R, R², adjusted R², RMSE, MAE
Confidence intervals for coefficients
Statistical significance testing (p-values)



Model Validation and Improvement:

Cross-validation with k-fold approach to assess generalizability
Residual analysis:

Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling)
Homoscedasticity tests (Breusch-Pagan)
Residual plots (vs. fitted, vs. predictors)


Comparison of alternative models:

Polynomial regression (assessing optimal degree)
Log transformations if appropriate
Model selection using AIC/BIC criteria



Predictive Application:

Generate 5-10 specific examples showing:

Inputs (Distance values)
Predicted Times from full dataset model
Predicted Times from Cycle-specific model
Prediction intervals (not just point estimates)
Comparison of predictions with analysis
