      "--- Prep Agent Description Output ---\n",
      "Based on the provided statistics, here is a detailed description of the necessary data preparation steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Missing Values in 'Time'**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The `Time` column has 278 non-missing values, but the dataset contains 281 rows. This indicates that there are 3 missing values in the `Time` column.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Impute the missing values in the `Time` column. Depending on the distribution of the data and the analysis goals, consider using the median (16.0, which is the 50th percentile) as a robust measure against outliers, or the mean (19.62) if the data is relatively symmetric. Document the imputation method for transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Outliers in 'Distance'**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The `Distance` column has a maximum value of 99.0, which is significantly higher than the 75th percentile (4.2). This suggests a potential outlier that may need further investigation.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Investigate the data point(s) with a `Distance` value close to 99.0. Determine whether this value is valid (e.g., a legitimate long commute) or an error (e.g., a data entry issue). If it is an error, consider correcting or removing it. If it is valid, consider applying a transformation (e.g., log transformation) to reduce the impact of this outlier during analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Categorical Data Quality in 'Mode'**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The `Mode` column has 9 unique values, but the summary statistics do not provide a list of these values. It is possible that there are typos or inconsistent entries (e.g., 'Bas' instead of 'Bus', 'Cra' instead of 'Car', 'Walt' instead of 'Walk').\n",
      "   - **Action:** Check the unique values in the `Mode` column to identify potential typos or inconsistencies. Correct these issues by standardizing the entries (e.g., replacing 'Bas' with 'Bus'). If necessary, create a mapping dictionary to ensure consistency in the column.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **General Data Quality Checks**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The summary statistics indicate that the dataset has no apparent issues with the `Case` column, as it appears to be a unique identifier (minimum = 1, maximum = 281, count = 281). However, no further details about the column are provided.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Verify that the `Case` column contains unique values and no duplicates. This ensures that each row represents a distinct observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Standardization or Normalization (Optional for Analysis)**\n",
      "   - **Observation:** The `Distance` and `Time` columns have different ranges (e.g., `Distance` ranges from 0.2 to 99.0, while `Time` ranges from 2.0 to 57.0). Depending on the analysis or modeling approach, it may be necessary to standardize or normalize these columns to ensure comparability or improve algorithm performance.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Consider scaling the `Distance` and `Time` columns using standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling, depending on the requirements of the analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Actions:\n",
      "1. Impute missing values in the `Time` column (e.g., using the median or mean).\n",
      "2. Investigate and address potential outliers in the `Distance` column (e.g., validate or transform).\n",
      "3. Check and correct typos/inconsistencies in the `Mode` column by reviewing unique values.\n",
      "4. Verify the uniqueness of the `Case` column to ensure data integrity.\n",
      "5. (Optional) Standardize or normalize `Distance` and `Time` for comparability in analysis.\n",
