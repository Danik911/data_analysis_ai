      "   - **Action:** Impute the missing values in 'Time' to ensure the dataset is complete for analysis. Depending on the distribution of 'Time', use an appropriate strategy such as:\n",
      "     - Median imputation (more robust to outliers).\n",
      "     - Mean imputation (if the data is symmetrically distributed).\n",
      "   - **Why:** Missing values can lead to errors or biases in analysis, and imputation helps maintain the integrity of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Investigating Outliers in 'Distance':**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The 'Distance' column has a maximum value of 99.0, which is significantly larger than the 75th percentile (4.2). This suggests the presence of potential outliers.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Investigate the high values in 'Distance' to determine if they are valid:\n",
      "     - Check for data entry errors or inconsistencies.\n",
      "     - If valid, consider whether these values should be included in the analysis or treated separately (e.g., capped or logged).\n",
      "   - **Why:** Outliers can distort statistical analyses and model performance. Investigating them ensures data quality and prevents misleading results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Ensuring Data Quality in 'Mode':**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The 'Mode' column has 9 unique values. Based on the dataset context (commute modes), this might include standard categories like 'Car', 'Bus', 'Bike', etc. However, potential typos (e.g., 'Bas', 'Cra', 'Walt') or inconsistent formatting (e.g., case sensitivity) could exist.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Check the unique values in 'Mode' for:\n",
      "     - Typos or incorrect entries (e.g., 'Bas' instead of 'Bus').\n",
      "     - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., 'car' vs. 'Car').\n",
      "     - Unexpected categories that do not fit the context (e.g., unrelated modes).\n",

      "   - **Issue:** The 'Distance' column has a maximum value of 99.0, which is significantly larger than the 75th percentile (4.2). This suggests the presence of potential outliers.\n",
      "   - **Action:** Investigate the high values in 'Distance' to determine if they are valid:\n",

      "### 3. **Ensuring Data Quality in 'Mode':**\n",
      "   - **Issue:** The 'Mode' column has 9 unique values.

      "   - **Action:** Check the unique values in 'Mode' for:\n",
      "     - Typos or incorrect entries (e.g., 'Bas' instead of 'Bus').\n",
      "     - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., 'car' vs. 'Car').\n",
      "     - Unexpected categories that do not fit the context (e.g., unrelated modes).\n",
      "     - Correct or standardize these values as necessary.\n",
